# theatreclassique

Texts in XML-TEI from the théâtre-classique.fr collection.

A note on the texts:

* Folder "tei4" contains the original TEI P4 files
* Folder "tei5" contains the transformed TEI P5 files. They have less metadata in the header. They have speaker IDs which are unique across the entire collection.
* Folder "metadata" contains some of the metadata regarding authors and personae from the TEI P4 files which have not been preserved in the TEI P5. Also, a mapping from the original file names (of the type "author_title") to the CLiGS identifiers (of the type "tc1234").
* All TEI P5 files are valid against the CLiGS schema located at: https://github.com/cligs/reference/tree/master/tei/standard (and included here for convenience)
