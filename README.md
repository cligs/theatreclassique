# theatreclassique

Texts in XML-TEI from the théâtre-classique.fr collection published by Paul Fièvre. Only plays written or performed between 1610 and 1800 and originally created in French have been retained.  

A note on the texts:

* The folder "tei" contains the XML-TEI P5 master files. Compared to the XML-TEI P4 files from which they derive, they have less metadata in the header. They have speaker IDs which are unique across the entire collection.
* The folder "txt" contains plain text versions derived from the TEI files. Only speaker text has been retained, so that prefaces and notes but also act/scene heads, stage directions and speaker names are not included. 
* The folder "metadata" contains the main "metadata.csv" file with descriptive metadata on each play as well as some of the metadata regarding authors and personae from the XML-TEI P4 files which have not been preserved in the XML-TEI P5. 
* All XML-TEI files are valid against the CLiGS schema located at: https://github.com/cligs/reference/tree/master/tei/standard (and included here for convenience)
* See <https://github.com/dlina/project/tree/master/data/zwischenformat/theatre-classique> for a "Zwischenformat" version of a similar set of plays.
* See also: <https://github.com/dramacode/dramacode.github.io> for many more file formats
